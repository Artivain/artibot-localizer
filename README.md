# artibot-localizer
Small and simple localization module for the Artibot project

Yes, this is commonjs only. It has been made for the [Artibot](https://github.com/Artivain/artibot) project, which is in commonjs.
Maybe esm could be added in future but anyway I doubt anyone will use this module other than for Artibot.
